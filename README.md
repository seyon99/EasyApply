## Motivation
  The project is a web application that is designed to help: job-seekers find and apply for jobs, employers find skilled candidates, and professional career experts to offer their expertise. While other sites like this exists, the project is designed to use modern algorithms to make it easier for job-seekers and employers. For example, job-seekers can submit writte resumes and short video "elevator pitches", which will be automatically transcribed into profile details, which job-seekers can quickly submit and employers can quickly view. This should reduce the overall time and resources for job-seekers to apply for jobs and employers to find skilled candidates.
