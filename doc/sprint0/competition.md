The concept of Easy App-ly isn't new. There are plenty of existing products like LinkedIn (https://ca.linkedin.com/), Indeed (https://ca.indeed.com/), or Glassdoor (https://www.glassdoor.ca/index.htm) making it easier than ever to help you find the job you want.

What makes Easy App-ly stand out is the optional addition of a video you can add in the profile section of your resume. You can showcase some of your personal projects or talk about some of your work experiences. It serves as an elevator pitch for yourself, convincing employers on the edge of giving you an interview that you're not completely exaggerating your talents on your resume.

What's more is that employers can leave a rating on your profile. The higher rating your profile is, the higher you will stand out amongst the other candidates.

This video feature is available to every user of the app, though some may not feel comfortable with using it. That's ok by all means as this is a completely optional feature.

When an applicant applies for the job, employers would most likely review your resume first. If the resume is stellar, they might jump straight to arranging an inteview. If it is not, then employers might spend a couple moments looking at your profile video just to confirm if you are a good potential candidate. The video can be a pre interview guage for them.

Competitors did not focus on this feature probably because there was never a need for it. After all, ultimately your resume will be the biggest factor towards getting that job. But as more and more people are graduating and entry level jobs are getting oversaturated, the need for something else to judge a candidate by may become essential to save time for both the job poster and the job applyer. This is where the video feature comes in, and in the future it may in fact be implemented by these companies.
