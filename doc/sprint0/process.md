# Process

We organized the team by creating a Discord chat, after which we migrated to a dedicated Discord server. The majority of our communication occurs on that Discord server, and we will make channels for discussing bugs and such once we start coding. We are using GitHub for version control, and we will be using Jira for bug tracking and agile project management.

We had a meeting where we decided on which startup we would work with, and we decided on ezApply. To formulate user stories, we met with ezApply's founder (Reggie Waterman) and discussed features and potential problems we foresaw. After this meeting, we formulated a list of user stories, and we unanimously voted that the previously brainstormed user stories would be sufficient.

In total, we met three times. In the future, we plan on using Jira to assign tickets to members of the group to ensure the workload is distributed as evenly as possible.
