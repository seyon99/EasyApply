Project Objectives, key users, scenarios, principles

The goal of this project is to create a minimum viable product of Easy App-ly, a concept created by Reggie Waterman. 

The idea of Easy App-ly is quite similar to normal job search websites like LinkedIn or Glassdoor. What will be different about it is that in the profile section, you are also given an option to upload an elevator pitch of yourself. This may include you showcasing your projects, or talking about your previous work experiences. Employers will be given the oppurtunity to listen to you talk about yourself as well as check out your resume that you've included alongside your profile. If their happy with your pitch, an option to leave a review will also be available. The higher your review is, the better your profile will stand out against other applicants when applying for jobs.

Another feature is a browser plug in. The goal of Easy App-ly is to make job search easier. This is especially true when applying on companies websites directly, where you have to spend around 30 minutes filling out the same text boxs asking to list your name and experiences and such. What this plugin shall do is autocomplete the form, really saving you time to look for more openings.

Our MVP will include the above properties amongst others. We want to create an app in which users can sign in and out of their accounts. When they sign in, they should be able to view and edit their profile. This includes uploading or deleting their elevator pitch or maybe updating their resume, or adding new skills. Job openings based on the interests of the user should also appear. They will be given the option to refine search results (e.g. location, salary, job type, experience needed). Jobs that catch their interest they will be able to apply to with the click of a button.

Outside the app, when looking for jobs externally, the Easy App-ly plugin should be available. All it takes is a click of a button and the required forms will be instantly filled.

Key users of the app are employers and employees. People looking to create a job opening and attract attention as soon as possible and people who are searching for jobs.

Key use cases of the app for employers will be creating an account for their company, listing some basic information about themselves and maybe even have a short video showing how nice it would be to work for them. They will also be able to list a job opening and included in it out the necessary fields like qualification & experiences. Once a job opening is taken, they will be able to close it and prevent further applicants from applying.

Key use cases for employees would be creating an account for themselves in which they are able to apply for jobs, as well as creating a profile in which they can express themselves much more creatively than the traditional way. The plugin would be used when applying on external sites.

Key scenarios for employers would be in the case of a newly vacant spot in their company and they are looking to find someone to fill the spot up. What they would do from there would be to create an account, create a company profile, and create/close a job opening as needed.

For applicants or anyone else, they would use the app and plugin when looking for a job on the app or externally. What they would first do is create an account, followed by flushing out their profile before applying for jobs.
