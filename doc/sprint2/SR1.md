# Sprint 1 Retrospective\

#What went well in Sprint 1?\
  The team quickly took to the tech-stack (MERN) so that we were able to begin working on design and implementation
relatively quickly. The strong foundations implemented should help us quickly begin developing in future sprints.
For a new group, the efficiency of work distribution based on previous skillsets was very impressive and the team
was able to work on things they were both interested in, comfortable with, and capable of learning.\

#What went wrong in Sprint 1?\
  A lack of push and communication led to one of our PRs being uncompleted for the sprint, which we had to push over
to the next sprint. \

#What did we learn?\
  Moving forward, if there are dependecies upon the work/tickets of others, we will more clearly communicate and
set up completion times for blockers. This should ensure that all of our PRs are compelted for the sprint.\

#How should the next sprint play out?\
  While Sprint 2 begins on reading week, many members of the team have work or assignments that need to be considered.
The team will be building upon the foundations set up in Sprint 1, and working to incoporate some of the obersvations
that have been collected to make the work flow smoother, such as more consistant communication between team members
working on adjacent components. The overall goal of Sprint 2 is to finish developing the foundational components (basic expectations)
and begin working on satisfiers and delighters.\
