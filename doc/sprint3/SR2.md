# Sprint 2 Retrospective

### What went well in Sprint 2?
We implemented several more features (uploding pitch video, allowing users to apply to a job, API for creating and managing jobs, etc.), and most of the JIRA tickets were completed successfully. GitHub pull requests were also reviewed by team members quicker than in Sprint 1. Since we already had experience working with the MERN stack in Sprint 1, so we were able to spend more time implementing features tahn learning the stack.

### What went wrong in Sprint 2?
We still had some communications issues, which led to blockers being resolved later on in the sprint.

### What did we learn?
We learned that we should set speciifc dates to complete tasks by, in order to prevent creating blockers. This would also prevent the burndown chart from indicating a lack of progress until the end of the sprint. We aslo learned we should meet more than 4 times per sprint to resolve issues quicker.

### How should the next sprint play out?
We will finalize the mongoose models, and try to standardize the styling of the UI. In addition to implementing new features, we will refactor whatever code thatfollows bad design patterns. As mentioned, we will attempt to complete JIRA tickets in a scheduled manner rather than at the end of the sprint.
