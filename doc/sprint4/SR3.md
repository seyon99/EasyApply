# Sprint 3 Retrospective

### What went well in Sprint 3?
We communicated properly and managed to fulfill our tickets in a critical order so that no one was unable to finish because of blockers. We were able to finish all high priority tickets for the sprint by planning ahead for the blockers. One such example is setting time aside to properly define our database models and thoroughly looking into all use cases of the models and types. We finished a few very difficult tickets such as those requiring video transcription and did not require to push them into the next sprint. 

### What went wrong in Sprint 3?
Due to midterms and other obligations we had started the sprint later than usual, causing us to have to push a few tickets into the next sprint. While this could be an issue of the team's time management we believe that this issue should not come up again as we no longer have midterms to worry about.

### What did we learn?
We are starting sprint 4 as soon as possible (when everyone is available) so that we can be sure we have the time to finish our remaining tickets. Since most of us do not have midterms to focus on we are more flexible with our schedules and can better organize with each other to finish any tickets that may require co-operation.

### How should the next sprint play out?
Being our last sprint, sprint 4 is the opportunity for us to finish the last of our tickets according to highest priority. Since we begin the sprint as early as possible we expect that we can close all of our remaining tickets of priority and create a minimal viable product.
